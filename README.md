This repository contains an implementation of the Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma and the Game of Evolution of Trust. The code simulates a tournament-style competition where various strategies (agents) compete against each other in iterated games of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The strategies evolve based on their performance in the tournament.

## Overview
The Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game theory scenario where two players must decide whether to cooperate or defect. The Game of Evolution of Trust extends this concept by allowing agents to evolve and adapt their strategies based on past interactions.

## Strategy Descriptions

- **Cooperative:** Always cooperates.
- **Cheater:** Always defects.
